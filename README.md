Ethan Wood Review Ranking Project

Reviews are ranked from least authentic to most authentic, 
and the 3 least authentic reviews are then printed to the command line. 

The ranking is currently quite simple and is based on a count of the 
exclamation points in the body of the review. However, the current system is 
flexible and allows for more complicated ranking logic to be added with
minimal refactoring.
